This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Step 1: Download the data file
url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2Fss06hid.csv"
destfile <- "ss06hid.csv"
download.file(url, destfile)

# Step 2: Load the data into R
data <- read.csv(destfile)
#newData <- filter(data, ACR > 10, AGS > 10000)

# Step 3: Create the logical vector
# The variables for acreage and agriculture sales need to be identified from the codebook
# Assume the variables are named ACR and AGS respectively for this example
# ACR == 3 indicates households on greater than 10 acres
# AGS > 10000 indicates households that sold more than $10,000 worth of agriculture products

agricultureLogical <- data$ACR == 3 & data$AGS > 10000
#agricultureLogical <- filter(data, ACR == 3, AGS > 10000)

# Step 4: Use which() to identify the rows
result <- which(agricultureLogical)

# Get the first 3 values
first_three_values <- result[1:3]

# Print the first 3 values
print(first_three_values)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
